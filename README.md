# Password Generator

## Description

Sometimes we can eaisly end up repeating one password several times exposing our work to the risk of hacking. This project is to make the work of a developer or any user with lots of sensitive information to easily generate complex password to protect their work. It prevents hacking because of using simple passwords that can be easily guessed, and it also prevents repetitive passwords. I learned that one can create very useful applications and websites with JavaScript.

## Installation

Just click the following link to view the password generator website https://cheptegei-create.github.io/password-generator/

## Usage

When you open the website, the user will see a header "Password Generator", and a text area with a generate password button. When the user clicks the button, a prompt box pops up of the screen to select the number of characters he or she wishes to have in the password. If the user selects less than 8 characters, an alert pops up indicating that your password must be atleast 8 characters. If the user selects more than 129 characters, an alert pops indicating that the password must be less than 129 characters. If the user selects the required length of characters, an alert pops up indicating that the user has selected a specific number of characters. After, a series of confirmation box pops up to request the user for more criterias such as numeric numbers, special characters, uppercase characters, and lowercase characters. If the user does not select any of the criterias, an alert pops up indicating that atleast one selection is required. If all the criterias are met, the password is generated and displayed on the textarea.
